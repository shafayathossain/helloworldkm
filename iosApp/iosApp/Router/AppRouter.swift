/// The `AppRouter` class provides an application-specific router for SwiftUI apps that can handle navigation changes based on route types, which are defined by the generic parameter `T`. This router acts as the central navigation controller, maintaining a stack of routes and providing functions to manipulate this stack, such as `push`, `pop` and `popTo`.
///
/// The router uses a `Logger` instance for logging navigation changes, which can be configured for debug or non-debug modes. By default, an `EmptyLog` is used, which does nothing. If the `debug` parameter is set to true in the initializer, a `DebugLog` is used which logs to the console.
///
/// The current routes stack is stored in `_routes`, which is a private property to prevent external mutation. A public `routes` computed property is provided for read access to the routes stack.
///
/// Two callback properties, `onPush` and `onPopLast`, are used to inform external components about navigation changes. These callbacks are invoked with relevant parameters when a push or pop operation occurs.
///
/// An optional initial route can be provided during initialization, which is pushed onto the stack.
///
/// Navigation can be performed by invoking the `push`, `pop` and `popTo` methods. The `push` method adds a route to the top of the stack and invokes the `onPush` callback. The `pop` method removes the last route from the stack and invokes the `onPopLast` callback. The `popTo` method removes all routes from the stack until it reaches the specified route, and then invokes the `onPopLast` callback. If the `inclusive` parameter is set to true, the specified route is also removed.
///
/// A special `onSystemPop` method is provided to handle situations where the system (or user) navigates back, for example by a swipe gesture. This method pops the last route from the stack without invoking the `onPopLast` callback.
///
/// **Example:**
///
/// Suppose you have an enumeration representing various routes in your application, such as:
///
/// ```swift
/// enum AppRoutes: Equatable {
///     case home
///     case profile
///     case settings
/// }
/// ```
/// You can create an instance of AppRouter with an initial route and enable debug mode as follows:
///  ```
///  let router = AppRouter<AppRoutes>(initial: .home, debug: true)
///  ```

/**
 `NavigationStyle` is an `ObservableObject` that manages the navigation bar's state across different views in a SwiftUI application.

 This class publishes two properties: `isHidden` and `title`, which represent the visibility and the title of the navigation bar respectively.

 - `isHidden`: A Boolean value indicating whether the navigation bar should be hidden. When a view modifies this value, it also sets `isHiddenOwner` to its identifier. This allows for precise control over which view's settings are currently applied to the navigation bar. If another view tries to change `isHidden`, it can check `isHiddenOwner` to see if it has the authority to do so.

 - `isHiddenOwner`: A string identifier of the current view that last set the `isHidden` property. It's used to ensure that the correct view's `isHidden` preference is respected, especially during view transitions or in cases of asynchrony where a view's `onAppear` or `onDisappear` event may execute at an unexpected time.

 - `title`: A string representing the current title of the navigation bar. Similar to `isHidden`, when a view modifies this value, it sets `titleOwner` to its identifier, ensuring that the correct view's title preference is respected.

 - `titleOwner`: A string identifier of the current view that last set the `title` property. It is used to manage potential race conditions between different views trying to update the navigation bar's title.

 **Note**: An `ObservableObject` is a type of object that SwiftUI watches for changes. When an `@Published` property changes, SwiftUI knows to recompute any views that rely on that object.
