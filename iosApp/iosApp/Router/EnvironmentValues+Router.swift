/**
 This extension adds functionality to SwiftUI's `EnvironmentValues` structure to allow SwiftUI views to interact with the navigation bar's visibility and title.
 
 - `uipNavigationStyle`: An instance of the `NavigationStyle` class, which encapsulates the properties for navigation bar visibility and title. This property is retrieved or set using a custom environment key `NavigationStyleKey`.
 
 - `upNavigationHidden`: A `Binding` to a Boolean value that represents the visibility of the navigation bar. When this value is updated, the corresponding change is made in the navigation bar's visibility. This property is retrieved or set using a custom environment key `NavigationHiddenKey`.
 
 - `upNavigationTitle`: A `Binding` to a String value that represents the current title of the navigation bar. When this value is updated, the corresponding change is made to the navigation bar's title. This property is retrieved or set using a custom environment key `NavigationTitleKey`.
 
 In SwiftUI, `EnvironmentValues` provides a collection of environment values for a view. Custom environment keys allow you to add your own data to the environment, enabling you to share values efficiently between views in your app.
